## Code standards:

Our code should follow some basic rules in order to make it more readable.

### CONSTANTS

Constants names should be upper-case, multiple words should be divided by an underscore
> for example:  
>
> ```F#
> let ROWS = 3
> let COLUMNS =7
> let COLOUR_WALL = ConsoleColor.White
> let WALL_CONNECTION_LEFT = '┤'
> ```

### VARIABLES

Variables names should be lower-case, multiple words should be divided by an underscore
> for example:  
>
> ```F#
> let test = 6
> let maze_tot = generate ROWS COLUMNS 3
> ```

### FUNCTIONS

Function names should be lower-case, multiple words should be divided by an underscore
> for example:  
>
> ```F#
> let rec generate rows cols chunk =
>       match chunk with
>       | 1 -> let gen = (generate_maze (generate_map rows cols))
>              printfn "Generating chunk n°%A" chunk
>              gen
>       | _ -> let gen = (connect_default (generate rows cols (chunk-1)) (generate_maze (generate_map rows cols)))
>              printfn "Generating chunk n°%A" chunk
>              gen
> ```

### FILES

Files names must begin with a capital letter and match the main module (or namespace) defined in the file.
Files must be ordered from the more general ones to the more specific, the last file in the solution explorer must me the ```[<EntryPoint>]```
> for example:  
>
> ```F#
> Maze.fs
> Utils.fs
> ```

### COMMENTS

Comments should follow the [XML standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/xml-documentation) used for .NET projects. The documentation is generated at compile time using [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/).
